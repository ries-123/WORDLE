Comet
-A comet is a “dirty snowball” of ice and rocky debris, typically a few miles across, that orbits the Sun in a long ellipse. When close to the Sun, the warmth evaporates the ice in the nucleus to form a coma (cloud of gas) and a tail. Named for their discoverers, comets sometimes make return visits after as little as a few years or as long as tens of thousands of years.

Mount
The device that supports your telescope, allows it to point to different parts of the sky, and lets you track objects as Earth rotates. A sturdy, vibration-free mount is every bit as important as the telescope’s optics. A mount’s top, or head, can be either alt-azimuth (turning side to side, up and down) or equatorial (turning parallel to the celestial coordinate system). “Go To” mounts contain computers that can find and track celestial objects automatically once the mounts have been aligned properly.
Phase
-The fraction of the Moon or other body that we see illuminated by sunlight.

Apsis
-In the orbit of a planetary body, one of the two extreme points of distance between the body and its primary – either the point of minimal distance, called the periapsis, or the point of maximal distance, called the apoapsis. The term may also be used to refer to the value of the distance rather than the point itself. All elliptical orbits have exactly two apsides.
Bulge
-A tightly packed group or cluster of stars within a larger star formation.
Epoch
-A moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity, such as the celestial coordinates or orbital elements of an astronomical object, because such quantities are subject to perturbations and change over time. The primary use of astronomical quantities specified by epochs is to calculate other relevant parameters of motion in order to predict future positions and velocities. In modern usage, astronomical quantities are often specified as a polynomial function of a particular time interval, with a given epoch as the temporal point of origin.
Lunar
-Of or relating to the Earth's Moon.
Nadir
-The point on the celestial sphere that is exactly opposite the zenith.[7] Thus, where the zenith is directly above an observer, the nadir is underfoot. The zenith and nadir form the two poles of the horizon line.
Orbit
-The gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the trajectory of a planet moving around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Though the smaller body is often said to orbit the larger body itself, both bodies actually follow approximately elliptical orbits around a common center of mass positioned at a focal point of each ellipse. The word "orbit" can variously refer to the elliptical trajectory itself or the act of following this trajectory, and can refer to a stable, regularly repeating trajectory as well as a non-repeating trajectory.
Solar
-of, derived from, relating to, or caused by the sun (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar) 
Flare (Solar)
-An intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere.
Space
-the region beyond the earth's atmosphere or beyond the solar system (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/space) 
Titan
-Saturn’s largest moon. It has an earthlike cycle of liquids flowing across its surface. It is the only moon with a thick atmosphere. (https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/) 
Umbra
-the complete or perfect shadow of an opaque body, as a planet, where the direct light from the source of illumination is completely cut off (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/umbra)
Virgo
-Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac. The name means "maiden" in Latin and its traditional astrological symbol is . Between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, lying in the south, it is the second-largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra) and the largest constellation in the zodiac. The ecliptic intersects the celestial equator within this constellation and Pisces. Underlying these technical two definitions, the sun passes directly overhead of the equator, within this constellation, at the September equinox. Virgo can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica, (in Latin "grain headed").  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)) 

Earth
-the planet third in order of distance from the sun, between Venus and Mars; the world on which we live (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/earth) 

Venus
-Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system (https://science.nasa.gov/venus/)

Pluto
-Pluto was once our solar system's ninth planet, but has been reclassified as a dwarf planet. It's located in the Kuiper Belt (https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/)

Libra
-Libra is a constellation located in the zodiac, represented symbolically as a set of scales, which reflects its association with balance and justice. It is best observed during June and July in the Northern Hemisphere and can be found between the constellations of Virgo and Scorpius. Historically, Libra has roots in ancient civilizations, where it was recognized for its significance in agricultural practices, as farmers relied on its visibility to determine planting and harvesting times. The name "Libra" originates from Latin, meaning "weighing scales," and it is unique among zodiac constellations as it represents an inanimate object rather than an animal or person. (https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/astronomy-and-astrophysics/libra)

  Alpha
-Alpha, used to designate the brightest star in a constellation. (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/alpha)

Aries
-Aries, in astronomy, zodiacal constellation in the northern sky lying between Pisces and Taurus, at about 3 hours right ascension and 20° north declination  (https://www.britannica.com/place/Aries)
Thebe
-Thebe, also known as Jupiter XIV, is an inner moon belonging to the outer planet of Jupiter. It is the seventh largest moon belonging to the planet of Jupiter. It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott with the aid from images from the space probe, Voyager 1 on March 5, 1979  (https://thesolarsystem.fandom.com/wiki/Thebe)

 Radio
-Electromagnetic radiation with the lowest frequency and the longest wavelength, produced by charged particles moving back and forth  (https://science.nasa.gov/universe/glossary/n-s/)

Light
-Light is electromagnetic radiation. In common use, light typically refers to electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that can be seen with the naked human eye. The wavelength of light that can be seen by humans is broadly in the range of 380–750 nanometers (nm), although most humans have very little sensitivity to light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. This is a narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum that covers a wide range of wavelengths from gamma (the shortest) to radio waves (the longest). More broadly the term light is sometimes applied to any electromagnetic radiation. (https://astro4edu.org/resources/glossary/term/175/)

Night
-Night is a period of darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. Night lasts from sunset to sunrise. On most of the Earth, each 24-hour day has one night. However, north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle, there are periods of darkness around the winter solstice where the polar night can last for months. These areas have no night around the time of the summer solstice. (https://astro4edu.org/resources/glossary/term/462/)

Dwarf
-Dwarf can have three meanings. Dwarf planets are defined as objects that orbit the Sun, and are nearly round, but have not been able to clear their orbit of debris. Dwarf star is a synonym for a star on the so-called main sequence: Stars that fuse hydrogen to helium in their cores. Stars spend most of their "lives" as dwarf stars. Our Sun is a middle-aged dwarf. Typically, when astronomers refer to such main sequence stars, they include a reference to the color, such as "red dwarf" for the most common, low-mass dwarf stars, or "yellow dwarf" for stars like our Sun. A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy that is unusually faint either because of its very small size, or its very low surface brightness, or both. Typically, dwarf galaxies are at most as luminous as a billion times the solar luminosity, corresponding to less than one percent of the luminosity of our own home galaxy, the Milky Way. There are numerous different types of dwarf galaxy including dwarf ellipticals, dwarf spheroidals, dwarf spirals, and dwarf irregular galaxies. One of the most important examples of dwarf galaxies is the Small Magellanic Cloud, which is a dwarf irregular satellite of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.

Deneb
-a star of the first magnitude in Cygnus. It represents the tail of the great swan in the constellation Cygnus and is seen embedded in the ribbon of the Milky Way, with Vega, a past and future North Star, shining directly below, close to the horizon. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Deneb)

Helix
-A nebula known as the Helix Nebula, sometimes referred to as the 'Eye Of God Nebula', is an object known as a planetary nebula located 650 lightyears away and seen in the constellation Aquarius. (https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/helix-nebula)

Orion
-Orion is an easily recognizable constellation near the celestial equator. In the northern hemisphere, it is a prominent winter constellation; in the southern hemisphere, a prominent summer constellation. In Greek myth, Orion was a hunter, and the constellation's main stars are typically interpreted as representing Orion's shoulders, his belt, the sword hanging from his belt, and his two feet. Most of those stars are blue giants or supergiants, that is, particularly bright blueish stars in the later stages of stellar life. The left shoulder star, Betelgeuse, is a red supergiant, that is, a very bright red star in the final stage of its life. Its reddish color can readily be seen in the night sky. Orion's sword contains the Orion nebula. Seen with the naked eye, it is a whitish smudge. Astronomical telescopes have shown it to be a bright red cloud of hydrogen gas where new stars are currently being born. (https://astro4edu.org/resources/glossary/term/467/)

Ceres
 -Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it's the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801 (https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/ceres/facts/)
